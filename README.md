# CharityBeSure-ApplicationCode
This is the code behind CharityBeSure - an application developed in Hack/MaketheBank London 2015

This app makes charitable donations more transparent by enabling the ‘donator’ of money to see where in the world their 
money was sent. For example, if they believed that their money was being sent to Libera, it would arouse their suspicion 
if the money ended up in Japan.
